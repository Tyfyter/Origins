			It is because of the stars that I even have my magic. The stars that fall when night comes crash into the ground and emanate such energy that you can only find in the cosmos. We call this "mana". It is a natural resource that we use for magical abilities. It is because of this mana that Terraria can be alive.

		I sought a wealth of knowledge and that led me here. I couldn't get anywhere being the middleman of it all, filling in for the role in everybody else's life. I pursued knowledge because I had nothing else. In order to get what I had wished, I had to divulge in little misdeeds. This kind of magic came with its curses, but I could've cared less about what the others thought. Despite my curses, I found my place in the world as its maintainer.

I met many faces and went to many places, seeing the kinds of people that made my life interesting. But, people only recognized me because I was dangerous.

Cthulhu's blood had spilled into the world, a random crevice the parasite had remained dormant in for eons. The parasite was affected, turning into a parasitic version of itself. It is not evil by nature, it is evil by design.

		It was like any other Wednesday morning. I went outside my post after devising plans to improve the security, but it was the sunrise that made it all worth it. Whenever the sun came up and the dew came to gently lay on the scrap piles, I knew my day would be over and would immediately feel relief and satisfaction. Do not get me wrong, the work was long and arduous, and due to the unfavorable working hours I would seldom see my son and wife. But, they have been known to visit, at least my son has. He always comes to visit his father, and it warms my heart. Ever since Lauren sent him over for donuts, I've been blessed. But, that one Wednesday was different and shaped the nature of my work greatly. See, I wasn't originally a part of the department of robotics, I specialized in security and defense systems. My son came to me and asked me, "Daddy, why can't robot soldiers be built so real people don't have to die?" My heart instantly melted, and I cried hugging him. Ever since that moment I've been inspired by my son's ideas, at first expressing my skepticism but eventually opening up to realize our society can support his ideas. I took action to cross-specialize immediately so I could make my son happy, not realizing that this would be the worst mistake of my life. I changed shops and got demoted to a craftsman, beginning a new line of work that would hopefully make my son happy. I didn't care about the benefits it would provide me, no, I was just fueled by a father's love. I worked through the castes fast thanks to pre-requisite knowledge and became a senior with a specialization in warfare mechanics. My first project was arguably my most-successful, you may know it as the "Trenchmaker". That was its given name, but after what took place they're all referred to by their model numbers. The TM-PS1 was the first design I made to serve as a "war engine" as the MT himself would classify, a term he created just for it and that would be reused for future warfighting machinery. It was prestigious, but the best part was my son's reaction to the TM-PS1. He fell in love with it and wanted to play with it often, of course, I had to watch him to make sure he didn't get into the circuitry and accidentally blow something up but he had a blast riding on it nonetheless. The TM-PS and TM-MT lines would prove successful in our wars against our rivals, but it got ugly really fast after we killed those cultists. I had told my son and wife to run away as fast as they could the moment I saw the fires in the sky, this time it wasn't a factory blowout. Before I could get to the control room to assist the other network engineers, there were already war engines positioned outside and killing everyone. One of them was my very own creation aiming right at me and opening fire. Fortunately, I survived the initial attack from quick reflexes, but this time I wasn't having to quickly shut off a hydraulic valve from overloaded flexitubes. Everytime I recall the old memories it just makes it all more sour. My machines killed everyone and I can't forgive myself for it. I promised myself to never leave until the "Ashen" is powered off for good, so here I am.

		Text:
			'''
			Ah, I see you've got your hands on an "explosive" item. Explosive weapons deal high damage, but receive reduced damage bonuses and are greatly affected by defense. They also tend to be more expensive and rely heavily on your aim because of their often-slow velocities. Fortunately, this reality of Terraria has some possible explosive equipment that could be manifested, but even the equipment is generally the lowest in terms of defense (as to permit flexibility and mobility). All of this and to mention that you could blow yourself up along with the world. Don't get caught in the blast radius of your own explosives!

			It's not all that bad to run with the rockets, however, it just requires a different level of play that running other classes might not have. Fortunately, some explosive weapons are safe to the user, but if they aren't there are plenty of items to provide you with "self-damage" protection. Not to mention, your explosives will only deal self-damage according to your own defense too!

			Being a "demolitionist", as they're called, makes you a literal 'glass cannon'. You have minimal defenses, but your offensive capabilities are off the charts. The blast radius of all explosives allows you to attack multiple enemies at once and even hit them indirectly if you're a bad shot.

			Oh, and one more thing: grenades are good for crowd-control, dynamite is good for single targets and bombs are an in-between. Yes, dynamite and bombs can be used offensively despite blowing up the world. That's just what a Pincushion from the Clothier is for. Also, look for any armor penetration bonuses to make them ignore defense and deal more damage!

			[header:Felnum]
			[jimage/sc3d:Origins/Tiles/Other/Felnum_Ore_Item] [jimage/sc3dw800:Origins/Items/Materials/Felnum_Bar]

			*****

			Overview: 
				- Felnum is mostly known for its "electrical greed" in that it builds up a crystalline material known as "felnum crust" to trap electrons that try to escape despite already having a strong negative charge. Felnum can be found in the floating isles of Terraria where it saps the static electricity culminating in the clouds. It is said that lightning would strike all the time during thunderstorms if it weren't for felnum.
							
			Characteristics: 
				- Felnum in its unrefined state adopts a similar appearance to that of copper ore, and then fades into a desaturated gold-brown color when hardened. It has a very prominent luster, isn't too malleable, and possesses a worse thermal conductivity than its copper equivalent.
							
			Origins: 
				- Felnum's development on Terraria is due to a high presence of mana throughout the world. It manifests due the high presence of mana particles in conjunction with the appropriate elements in the area. The greatest way to manifest Felnum is to transmute Copper Ore [i:CopperOre] by blessing it at a Crystal Ball [i:CrystalBall].
							
			Chemistry:
				- Felnum is mostly used as a capacitor when it is not being combined with other materials. It can be used best in battery-technology applications where a power source is necessary. Aside from its applications, Felnum can be further blessed into Valkyrum [i:Origins/Valkyrum_Bar] by combining it with Ectoplasm [i:Ectoplasm] released by Dungeon Spirits and Aetherite [i:Origins/Aetherite_Bar] dropped by a mysterious-yet-powerful guardian of the Aether. Based on early analysis, Felnum could likely be used in applications of providing energy in the form of electrolytes.
							
			History: 
				- Felnum is an artificial metal material conjured by the wizards of the Bastille (dungeon). Its sole purpose was to prevent lightning strikes from rapidly striking the lands of Terraria during thunderstorms to allow for the development of villages. Felnum's presence can greatly harm Terraria if not applied carefully as thunderstorms are just a way for Terraria to naturally combat manifested evils on the surface.
							
			Symbolism:
				- Felnum is seen as blessing or a curse depending on who you ask due to its history. To the Order of Dryads that once lived in Terraria, it is seen as a grave mistake to restoring balance in the world. To the settlers of the surface, it can be seen as a blessing shielding them from the destructive thunderstorms.

Touching Mojo feels extremely refreshing and saturating as it is said to make you younger. Could possibly explain why the Dryad is so old! 
								
			Characteristics: 
				- Contrary to the bright blue-green coloration of the Primordial Amoeba, Alkahest takes on a bright, almost straw-colored yellow color. Alkahest also has almost no viscosity as well and is very reflective.
								
			Origins: 
				- As previously mentioned, Alkahest first appeared on Terraria due to the Primordial Amoeba that naturally synthesizes it to digest all matter for nutrition. There is no known way to synthesize Alkahest artificially.
								
			Chemistry:
				- Alkahest has a wide range of applications including general waste removal, energy generation, heat generation, and other purposes. Alkahest is most commonly used for combat and alchemy, due to how easily capable of dissolving matter it is.
								
			History: 
				- Alkahest is a relatively newer material that has sprouted into the mix thanks to some early Terrarian history. Before the Primordial Amoeba became a keystone species for the {§Riven_Hive}, it was like any other single-cellular organism. When Cthulhu's invasion on Terraria's inhabitants came to a conclusion after his lower half was severed, his blood was said to spill into the caverns of the world, corrupting the very pool of water that the Primordial Amoeba resided. As part of its prompted, rapid evolution, the Amoeba gained the ability for Alkahest synthesis and used it to shape the surrounding environment.

There were loud crashing noises and unearthly screams coming from a faraway horizon as the wilderness grew rampant and even more violent. The cities were eventually overwhelmed by the creatures of Hell as they became more powerful and populous.

		What's left are only the constructs of the inhabitants that once lived there. Some are said to still roam along the ashen ground of the underworld to this day.

		So, they call themselves the Cuboids, but they're a part of the Cubekon race, just to clarify… after looking into their data, they seem to be from another world and are somehow trapped here for some reason. My question is, with this wealth of technological advance, why haven't they gotten out of here yet? Not even I know that. What I do know is what's inside of them.

		The Cuboids seem to be entirely mechanical in nature with a brain made out of these weird green cubes, which I'll just call 'qubes' for now. These 'qubes' act like a power source and data storage membrane in one. How I know that is because they make branch out in a very symmetric way all over the body of these Cuboids. There's also a lot of other machinery in here that I can only assume allows these things to move since I recently discovered that they have a consciousness, but that's a bit complicated…
