Terraria Origins is a content mod that adds new ways of playing Terraria with content designed and balanced around the vanilla game. It is full of many alternative playstyles to complement the base game for you to enjoy. More content is planned in the future. You can see our completion list for what we have planned next: https://github.com/Tyfyter/Origins/blob/master/completionList.txt .

Origins is currently in its Open Beta version, still including 1055 items, 148 NPCs, 269 tiles, 6 biomes and 5 bosses. 
Additionally, there is a new explosive-themed Demolitionist class that has content throughout the entire game and is balanced with the other classes.

Origins' content adds alternatives for nearly all areas of gameplay reinforced by its two new world evils: the Defiled Wastelands and Riven Hive. The Corruption and Crimson also have content added to make them melee and ranger-focused respectively while the Defiled is magic-focused and Riven being summoner-focused. It will be hard to not find something new and fun in Origins, even in its current Beta state.

This mod does not include the music tracks composed for each of the biomes and bosses, but it still has the unique sound effects for some of the content. The music can be found from the Music Mod here: https://s.team/sf/3476640589
There is a configuration option to toggle between Volumes of the soundtrack.
Both Volumes 1 and 2 can be found on their respective SoundCloud playlists below.
Volume I: https://on.soundcloud.com/DbwEvCydVjhwcijF8
Volume II: https://on.soundcloud.com/2bAEyAFQwV7XM8Me8
