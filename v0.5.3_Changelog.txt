Changes:
** Revamped the Riven Hive's generation and sprites
* Journal now gives mechanic guides
* Brine enemies now have banners
* Disabled Fiberglass Undergrowth background in Retro and Trippy lighting modes for improved performance

Balance:
- Defiled prefix no longer works on target dummies
- Wholesome prefix only works when the minion dies of natural causes


Fixes:
* Friendly Guardians no longer politely leave room for Servants of You or Little Protozoa to get in line with them, as the aforementioned minions don't believe in order
* Slightly changed the shape of evil biome horizontal edges
* Defiled prefix has proper value
* Acrid Pickaxe now uses the sharp end to mine
* Fiberglass Undergrowth no longer spawns directly under the Brine
