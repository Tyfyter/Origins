Terraria Origins is a content mod that adds new ways of playing Terraria with content designed and balanced around the vanilla game.

Origins is currently in its Open Beta version but still includes 780+ items, 78+ NPCs, many new tiles and new biomes. 
Additionally, there is a new explosive-themed Demolitionist class that has content throughout the entire game and is balanced with the other classes.

Origins' content adds alternatives for nearly all areas of gameplay reinforced by its two new world evils: the Defiled Wastelands and Riven Hive.
It will be hard to not find something new and fun in Origins, even in its current Beta state.

This mod includes the music tracks composed for each of the biomes and bosses, and unique sound effects for some of the items.
You can find streamable versions of the music on chrersis' SoundCloud: https://on.soundcloud.com/DbwEvCydVjhwcijF8
